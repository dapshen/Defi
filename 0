Defi DEX AMM Classic Standart V2 Liquidity Pools, How they work? (PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Uniswap).

Variables:

A – Token A(or supply)
B – Token B(or supply)
C – reserve of token “A” in LP
D – reserve of token “B” in LP
E – “A” tokens bought by swap
F – “B” tokens bought by swap
G – “A” tokens sold by swap
H – “B” tokens sold by swap
I – Price of token “A” in token “B” 
J – Price of token “B” in token “A”
K – Constant number (We need it for price and liquidity formulas, it is constant till someone adds/removes some LP)
L – LP tokens(LP tokens minted at the start of creating pool, or when someone adds/removes them)
M – Market Cap of token “A” in token “B”
N – Market Cap of token “B” in token “A”

Formulas:

K = C * D

L = √K

Amount of token “B” bought(F),
while selling amount of token “A”(G):
F = D – (K / (C + G))

Amount of token “A” bought(E),
while selling amount of token “B”(H):
E = C – (K / (D + H))

Amount of token “A” needed to sell(G),
to buy amount of token “B”(F):
G = (K / (D – F)) – C | Reverse Calculation

Amount of token “B” needed to sell(H),
to buy amount of token “A”(E):
H = (K / (C – E)) – D | Reverse Calculation

Price of token “A” in token “B”(I):
I = D / C

Price of token “B” in token “A”(J):
J = C / D

Market Cap of token “A” in token “B”(M):
M = I * A

Market Cap of token “B” in token “A”(N):
N = J * B
